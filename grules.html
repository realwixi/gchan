    <h1>Rules of Engagement</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Rule 1:</span> While writing, mention your pseudonym. Every time you enter, you must mention your pseudonym to continue the discussion. If you do not wish to do so, please leave. This rule ensures anonymity but allows us to recognize participants.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Rule 2:</span> Since this is a personal platform developed by me, you can ask me anonymous questions and feel free to ask anything.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Rule 3:</span> You are welcome to criticize me constructively. I value your perspective.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Rule 4:</span> Vulgar and bad words are not welcomed and will be deleted.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Rule 5:</span> This platform is to understand your perspective of me. If you dislike me, share why you feel that way. If you like me (haha), share why you feel that way.</li>
    </ul>
